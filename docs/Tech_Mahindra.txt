Tech Mahindra is an Indian multinational information technology services and consulting company. It was formed in 1986 as a joint venture between Mahindra & Mahindra and BT Group. Part of the Mahindra Group, the company is headquartered in Pune and has its registered office in Mumbai.


History

In 1986, Mahindra & Mahindra started a 60:40 joint venture technology services outsourcing firm with British Telecom named Mahindra British Telecom (MBT). In 2000, British Telecom committed business of at least £105 million over three years; as a consideration, British Telecom's stake in MBT increased to 43%. MBT primarily served the telecommunications industry in its early years, with British Telecom as its largest client.


In 2006, MBT was renamed as Tech Mahindra, and it became a publicly-listed company via an initial public offering. In December 2010, British Telecom sold 5.5% of its stake in Tech Mahindra to Mahindra & Mahindra for ₹451 crore. In August 2012, British Telecom sold 14.1% of its stake to institutional investors for about ₹1,395 crore. In December 2012, British Telecom sold its remaining 9.1% stake to institutional investors for ₹1,011.4 crore. This sale marked the exit of British Telecom from Tech Mahindra.


Acquisition and merger of Satyam

In the aftermath of the Satyam scandal, Tech Mahindra emerged as the top bidder for a 31% controlling stake in Satyam Computer Services, beating a bid from Larsen & Toubro, in April 2009. After the completion of the acquisition, Satyam Computer Services was renamed Mahindra Satyam in June 2009. Tech Mahindra's stake in Satyam increased to 42% through a preferential share allotment in July 2009.


In 2010, Mahindra Satyam and Morpho were awarded a contract by UIDAI to implement the biometric identification system for the Aadhaar programme. Mahindra Satyam, along with Tech Mahindra, was the official IT services provider for the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.


Tech Mahindra announced its merger with Mahindra Satyam on 21 March 2012, after getting approval of the two company boards. The new organization would be led by Anand Mahindra as Chairman, Vineet Nayyar as Vice Chairman, and C. P. Gurnani as the CEO and Managing Director. On 25 June 2013, Tech Mahindra completed the merger to become India's fifth largest software services company with a turnover of $2.7 billion. The merger diversified Tech Mahindra's revenue mix, with the telecommunication vertical's share declining from over 90% in 2009 to 47% in 2013.
